## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Upon opening the game, both players will be prompted to enter their names (you can add emojis too, like `👧🔴` or `🧑‍💻🔵`).
2. The board has 7 columns × 6 rows.
3. Players take turns clicking on a column to "drop" a colored chip into that column.
4. The chip falls to the lowest empty row available in that column.
5. The first player to connect **4 chips in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. 🎉
6. If the board is full and no player has won, it's a draw, manual detection
7. Click the **Restart Game** button to start a new match.
